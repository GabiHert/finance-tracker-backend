BDD Feature File Generation Instructions
You are tasked with creating a new .feature file for BDD (Behavior Driven Development) tests. Follow these strict requirements:
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

DO NOT create new step definitions or functions
ONLY use existing step definitions that are already implemented
Use the existing functions as they are - they are generic enough to handle all scenarios
Examine all existing .feature files in the project as examples and references
Follow the exact same patterns and conventions used in existing feature files

File location:
- feature files: /test/integration/features
- step definitions: /test/integration/steps
- mocks: /test/integration/mocks

Requirements

Analyze Existing Features: First, examine all existing .feature files in the project to understand:

The current step definition patterns
Naming conventions
Structure and format
Available step definitions (Given, When, Then statements)


Reuse Existing Steps: Only use step definitions that already exist in the codebase. The existing functions are designed to be generic and should cover all testing scenarios needed.
Follow Established Patterns: Maintain consistency with:

File naming conventions
Feature descriptions
Scenario structures
Tag usage (if any)
Data table formats (if used)


Structure Requirements:

Use proper Gherkin syntax
Include appropriate Feature description
Write clear Scenario names
Use meaningful but generic step definitions
Include Background steps if needed (following existing patterns)


Output Format
Generate a complete .feature file that:

Follows the same format as existing feature files
Uses only existing step definitions
Covers the requested functionality comprehensively
Maintains consistency with the project's testing approach
